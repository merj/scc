A sign/countersign contract client and server implementation and its supporting toolchain, intended primarily for software licencing.

Technical Details

Contracts are generated and securely signed locally, then remotely countersigned using public-key cryptography (ECDSA) over HTTP/HTTPS.

Exit Codes

Unless otherwise stated commands returns 0 on success, 1 on usage error, 2 on authorization error and 3+ for any other error.

Unexpected errors may produce unexpected output.
